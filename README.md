# Radar-AI-Enhancing-Object-Detection-with-Synthetic-Data-and-AI-driven-Classification
Autonomous vehicles rely on RADAR, LiDAR, and Camera to perceive their surroundings. ðŸ”¹ While RADAR works in all weather conditions, its low resolution makes object classification challenging. ðŸ”¹ How can we use AI to enhance RADAR perception? Thatâ€™s what I set out to explore.
